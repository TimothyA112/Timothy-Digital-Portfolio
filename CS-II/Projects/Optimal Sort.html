 <p style="font-size:35px;">Textual analysis </p>
  <p class="M" style ="font-size:25px;">The difference between the 3 sorts and their varouis run times are because how the code is generated
and how they run and sort the words differently.The most basic and most slow one is bubble sort.Bubble sort reads the first two letters and sees which one comes first in the standered  alphebet and swaps it if its  not in order or,if it is it does a pass and leaves it the same.This is the reason why is it so slow it singulary goes through everyword and checks it.Insertion sort is differnt and faster.They way that it works is that it reads the first elements in the unsorted array and then it picks the first element thats in order and sorts them all.So in stead of got 1 by 1 it scans all of it at once and thats what make it different and faster from bubblesort.The last one is Selection sort.Selection sort is when it looks over the array and grabs the minimum element and this makes it the fastest out all them.The overall thing that separetes them is how much each code can evualte the unsorted array and how quick it can do it.</p>
