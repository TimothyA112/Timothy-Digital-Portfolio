<p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Same issue as the previous week,testing the brakes at various speeds in order to see how well they work and for how long.Try them at speeds at consisting of 1,3,5 and 10 MPH and record the data and use
that data to improve the braking system to make it more user friendly and comfortable.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Technical Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Currently there are no technical issues this week so far.We are steadily working towards the finishing product of the roller blade.Overall the issues are going to be the same as last week
      involving the remote,motor and have them communicate freely.Another issue is developing a braking system that can be comfortable to use by the rider and provides enough braking power to slow down or stop the rider based on how much
      force is applied.I was thinking some kind of friction system where the rider pushes back or forward casing the shoe to rub against the wheel causing friction slowing it down.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Scheduling Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">There is still currently no scheduling issues,we all are on the same page and have a good idea of were we are at and where we at trying to get in the near future.We are still communicating with text
      and discord to keep in touch with each other.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Interpersonal Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">There are no interpersonal challenges, and I don't think there will ever be any.Group is mostly on the same page and are good with each other.So overall I don't think there will ever be any issues within the team.</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Technical Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Overall there are not any new technical challenges that have risen we're mainly still working on the past problems fixing and improving them to solve them.The main things again will most likely being able to code the remote and let it communicate smoothly with the motor attached to the wheel.Another issue that I think that we will have is with the assembly of the shoe and the motor and make sure its comfortable and also has a linear acceleration and not unpredictable.I believe that is all the issues that we will be facing this week.</p>
    
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Scheduling Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">There are not any more scheduling issues anymore because we can communicate more freely with texting and can easily collaborate with the help of shared docs,slides and GitHub.The only minor scheduling issue that I can think of is getting every team member to see or get there hands on the final product due to us being spread across 3 different class periods,but this can be easily solved by 1 person leaving the product in class and then every time a team member goes to their own class they can get a chance to see it.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Interpersonal Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">There are no interpersonal challenges, and I don't think there will ever be any.Group is mostly on the same page and are good with each other.So overall I don't think there will ever be any issues within the team.</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:70px;">Entry#5(6-Mar-2023)</p>
<p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Technical Challenges</p>
<p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">The technical challenges for this week are just to be able retrieve the remote and the motor and then make a code or get a pre-coded one that allows them to communicate smoothly and freely,with this we can easily
make sure the shoe will work well.Another thing we need to figure out is how the make the shoe comfortable for the user and safe with no slippage when the product is in use.</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Scheduling Challenges</p>
<p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Again there are usually no scheduling issues we can all communicate easily with the help of our phones and discord.   </p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Interpersonal Challenges</p>
<p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">I have no problems with any of my team members, we are all cool with each other and work together well.   </p>
 

<p class="M" style ="font-size:70px;">Entry#4(13-Feb-2023)</p>
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Technical Challenges</p> 
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Some technical challenges for this week are gonna be acquiring the code for the remote.Adding further on to that we need to figure out a way to code the remote to communicate to the electric motor attached to the wheel.Another challenge that we need to figure out is how to charge the battery.will it be USB or battery powered.I will need to communicate with my group and see how they want it to be powered.Last technical challenge for this week is going to be communication over text,but I'm trying to talk more with my team members and see what they want to do.
</p>

 <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Scheduling Challenges</p> 
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">The main issue is that we are not all in the same class,even worse they don't have CS on the same day as me so we have confusion when new assignments arise.For example I asked if they started the ISP slides presentation or they wanted to use mine since I already started and they has no idea what I was talking about.This can be resolved over time and explaining, but we don't have all the time in the world.Another scheduling challenges is finding time to work on the project together with everyone.
</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Interpersonal Challenges</p> 
<p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">I dint really have any issue with any of my group members accept they don't communicate at all,I think some of them or all of them are in the same class so they can easily communicate but with me is more challenges.Also I texted them about something and no one responded for a week so I resent the text and then one person responded and its always the same person.I think we all just need to communicate more and become more comfortable with each other and then we should be able to work better and more efficient.(2 days later)We are now communicating consistently and working a lot more efficiently and talking to each other and understating the project more deeply and were all on the same page.   <html>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  

    
<p class="M" style ="font-size:70px;">Entry#3(20-Jan-2023)</p>
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Technical Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">This weeks techno issues will probably be the same as last weeks which is assembling the code for the electric roller blades.Also another thing
      that will be an issue is communication,we can all talk to each other but no one it really communicating and this causes less work flow in the team and it becomes to a point to where nothing gets done.The same issue is with coding the controller for the electric roller blades.That's probably all the things that are technical issues for this week
</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Scheduling Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">These will almost be identical as last week problems and this involves us being in different class periods.This causes confusion and also
      doesn't help with the lack of communication but this will be an easy fix by I can just start more conversation and ask more question to almost try and spark the conversation.
      Another scheduling collagen will be finding a time when we can all talk together and make serous planes and decisions.
</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Interpersonal Challenges</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">These are also identical to alts weeks entry I'm not really hacking any problems with these people so I think the project will go smoothly once we start talking more frequently.Also like last weeks entry I dint really know any of my team members at all so I cant really not like them based of nothing.So overall I dint really have any interpersonal challenges at the moment.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:70px;">Entry#2(9-Jan-2023)</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Technical Challenges</p> 
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Some technical issues for this week I think are going to be an issue is  getting the right electronic devices for the product.Another
      issue will be re-explained the product because we switched from a 1 wheel hover-board to  electric roller blades.We can do some research and find the right
      electric motors that fit the right power out put and size for the roller blades.Also for  explaining the new product I can communicate with my team via messages
      or discord in order to further understand the final product and how they want it to look and work.I think one final technical issue for this week will be coding the motor
    in the Rollerblade's to a handheld remote of some sort,but we can do some research and use out knowledge from CS to make it work.</p>


    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Scheduling Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">One scheduling challenge that I had was I didn't have my team members contact info,but after emailing him
      he gave me his number and now we can communicate.We also made a group chat with our entire team and this will make scheduling a lot easier and
      overall work efficiently a lot better.We will still need to schedule times when we are all  available to talk about the  ISP and schedule assignments to
      each other.Even though we can do it with no communication using git hub,I think its better to be in direct communication with team members than
      just giving each other new tasks over and over again.This is an easy fix by we can just text on messages or make a group call on discord.</p>


    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Interpersonal Challenges</p> 
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Over all I don't think there will be an challenges with other team members.Other than me being in CS-II and I think there all In CS-II
      ,but this shouldn't be that big of an issue considering there isn't a lot of complex code within this ISP project.Also we are in different class periods so there wont be many or
      no face to face communication.This also means I will probably never get to meet them and see what their like and their personality,which doesn't allow me to know how to talk to them
      so we have no miscommunication or confusion in the project.This shouldn't be that big of a problem I think.We can probably learn each other over time by texting each other and see how each of us are.I don't really
    know any of these people in my group except for one from middle school,so I cant really have any issues with them yet.</p>




    <p class="M" style ="font-size:70px;">Entry#1(6-Jan-2023)</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">We will be creating a self balancing hover board so some of the
      technical challenge will be getting the right motor and a programmable one so we can implement our self-
      balancing code.Another technical issue will be actually writing a self-balancing code with input sensors and
      other things for it to work,but I think if we work together we should be able to figure something out and make it work
      .Also I think that we can find a motor that would meet out expectations for our project from a older model or a brand new single wheel motor.
      Another technical challenge would be getting
      all the sensors that we need to make the finished product work.
      For example we would need a weight sensor that reads how the weight is across the board and then it would send signals
      to the main motor CPU and uses those reading to balance out the board by accelerating or decelerating .Most of these
      sensors are in cars so manufactures might be selling them so that how we could get them or worse case we could re-wire a old sensor to read weight.
      The biggest challenge will defiantly be scheduling.It would be hard because I have work and he might have work to which would make it
      hard to find a given time to work together.We would probably have to it online with discord or some other communicating app in order to
      work together on the project.I don't think there will be any interpersonal challenges,I used to know one of my team members so we might have
      some past chemistry that can help us work together.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Roles/Jobs</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">(Software)Development Engineer</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">The development engineer is responsible for design and make the code for the overall project.They also build the different software systems
      within the given task.Their main task is to apply their software(coding) skills to real world things and developer to be ready to use with no flaws or errors.They also make
      sure the other team members code is also free of errors and help make the code run as fast and smooth as possible.Their also responsible for looking over all the code
      at the end or the publishing of a product or program.I think that I would give this job to someone that is in CS-III because they have more experience and can probably do a better job than me.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">QA Engineer</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A QA engineer (quality assurance engineer) is a professional who is responsible for testing and ensuring the quality of software and systems. QA engineers work to identify and fix defects and bugs in software, and to ensure that the software meets specified requirements and standards. They may work with developers to design and implement testing strategies, and may also work with users to gather feedback and identify issues. QA engineering is an important role in the software development process, as it helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and meets the needs of its users.We would probably need a complex group member to take care of this task and make sure that it all work correctly and nicely.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Project Manager</p>                                                                                                                                  <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, and overseeing the development of a project. They are responsible for setting project objectives, developing project plans, and managing project resources in order to deliver the project on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. Project managers may work on a wide range of projects, such as the construction of a building, the development of a new product, or the implementation of a new system or process. In order to be effective, project managers must have strong communication, organizational, and leadership skills. They must also be able to work under pressure and manage risk effectively.I fell like I would be capable to do this task because I have pretty well leadership skills and could lead a team in completing a good task on time.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Product Manager</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A product manager is a professional who is responsible for the development and management of a product throughout its life cycle. This can include identifying market opportunities, defining the product vision and road map, gathering and prioritizing product and customer requirements, and working with cross-functional teams to bring the product to market. Product managers typically work in technology or software companies, but can also be found in a variety of other industries. To be effective, product managers must have strong strategic and analytical skills, as well as excellent communication and leadership abilities. They must also be able to work effectively with cross-functional teams and to make decisions in a fast-paced, constantly-changing environment.I have some connections and know little things about advertising but I think that I could do this job by advertising.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Release Engineer</p>
     <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A release engineer is a professional who is responsible for managing the release process for software or other systems. This can include tasks such as building and testing software, creating and maintaining documentation, coordinating with various teams and stakeholders, and deploying software to production environments. Release engineers often work closely with developers, QA engineers, and operations teams to ensure that releases are completed efficiently and effectively. In order to be effective in this role, release engineers should have strong technical skills and experience with software development and deployment processes. They should also have excellent communication and organizational skills, and be able to work well under pressure.I could also do this task because it involves in releasing and advertising the product.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">We will be creating a self balancing hover board so some of the
      technical challenge will be getting the right motor and a programmable one so we can implement our self-
      balancing code.Another technical issue will be actually writing a self-balancing code with input sensors and
      other things for it to work,but I think if we work together we should be able to figure something out and make it work
      .Also I think that we can find a motor that would meet out expectations for our project from a older model or a brand new single wheel motor.
      Another technical challenge would be getting
      all the sensors that we need to make the finished product work.
      For example we would need a weight sensor that reads how the weight is across the board and then it would send signals
      to the main motor CPU and uses those reading to balance out the board by accelerating or decelerating .Most of these
      sensors are in cars so manufactures might be selling them so that how we could get them or worse case we could re-wire a old sensor to read weight.
      The biggest challenge will defiantly be scheduling.It would be hard because I have work and he might have work to which would make it
      hard to find a given time to work together.We would probably have to it online with discord or some other communicating app in order to
      work together on the project.I don't think there will be any interpersonal challenges,I used to know one of my team members so we might have
      some past chemistry that can help us work together.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Roles/Jobs</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">(Software)Development Engineer</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">The development engineer is responsible for design and make the code for the overall project.They also build the different software systems
      within the given task.Their main task is to apply their software(coding) skills to real world things and developer to be ready to use with no flaws or errors.They also make
      sure the other team members code is also free of errors and help make the code run as fast and smooth as possible.Their also responsible for looking over all the code
      at the end or the publishing of a product or program.I think that I would give this job to someone that is in CS-III because they have more experience and can probably do a better job than me.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">QA Engineer</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A QA engineer (quality assurance engineer) is a professional who is responsible for testing and ensuring the quality of software and systems. QA engineers work to identify and fix defects and bugs in software, and to ensure that the software meets specified requirements and standards. They may work with developers to design and implement testing strategies, and may also work with users to gather feedback and identify issues. QA engineering is an important role in the software development process, as it helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and meets the needs of its users.We would probably need a complex group member to take care of this task and make sure that it all work correctly and nicely.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Project Manager</p>                                                                                                                                  <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, and overseeing the development of a project. They are responsible for setting project objectives, developing project plans, and managing project resources in order to deliver the project on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. Project managers may work on a wide range of projects, such as the construction of a building, the development of a new product, or the implementation of a new system or process. In order to be effective, project managers must have strong communication, organizational, and leadership skills. They must also be able to work under pressure and manage risk effectively.I fell like I would be capable to do this task because I have pretty well leadership skills and could lead a team in completing a good task on time.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Product Manager</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A product manager is a professional who is responsible for the development and management of a product throughout its life cycle. This can include identifying market opportunities, defining the product vision and road map, gathering and prioritizing product and customer requirements, and working with cross-functional teams to bring the product to market. Product managers typically work in technology or software companies, but can also be found in a variety of other industries. To be effective, product managers must have strong strategic and analytical skills, as well as excellent communication and leadership abilities. They must also be able to work effectively with cross-functional teams and to make decisions in a fast-paced, constantly-changing environment.I have some connections and know little things about advertising but I think that I could do this job by advertising.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Release Engineer</p>
     <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A release engineer is a professional who is responsible for managing the release process for software or other systems. This can include tasks such as building and testing software, creating and maintaining documentation, coordinating with various teams and stakeholders, and deploying software to production environments. Release engineers often work closely with developers, QA engineers, and operations teams to ensure that releases are completed efficiently and effectively. In order to be effective in this role, release engineers should have strong technical skills and experience with software development and deployment processes. They should also have excellent communication and organizational skills, and be able to work well under pressure.I could also do this task because it involves in releasing and advertising the product.</p>
