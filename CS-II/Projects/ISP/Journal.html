    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Technical Challenges</p> 
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Some technical issues for this week I think are going to be an issue is  getting the right electronic devices for the product.Another
      issue will be re-explained the product because we switched from a 1 wheel hover-board to  electric roller blades.We can do some research and find the right
      electric motors that fit the right power out put and size for the roller blades.Also for  explaining the new product I can communicate with my team via messages
      or discord in order to further understand the final product and how they want it to look and work.I think one final technical issue for this week will be coding the motor
    in the Rollerblade's to a handheld remote of some sort,but we can do some research and use out knowledge from CS to make it work.</p>


    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Scheduling Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">One scheduling challenge that I had was I didn't have my team members contact info,but after emailing him
      he gave me his number and now we can communicate.We also made a group chat with our entire team and this will make scheduling a lot easier and
      overall work efficienty a lot better.We will still need to schedule times when we are all  available to talk about the  ISP and schedule assignments to
      each other.Even though we can do it with no communication using git hub,I think its better to be in direct communication with team members than
      just giving each other new tasks over and over again.This is an easy fix by we can just text on messages or make a group call on discord.</p>


    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Interpersonal Challenges</p> 
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Over all I dint think there will be an challenges with other team members.Other than me being in CS-II and I think there all In CS-II
      ,but this shouldn't be that big of an issue considering there isn't a lot of complex code within this ISP project.Also we are in different class periods so there wont be many or
      no face to face communication.This also means I will probably never get to meet them and see what their like and their personality,which doesn't allow me to know how to talk to them
      so we have no miscomunication or confusion in the project.This shouldn't be that big of a problem I think.We can probably learn each other over time by texting each other and see how each of us are.I don't really
    know any of these people in my group except for one from middle school,so I cant really have any issues with them yet.</p>










    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">Entry#1(6-Jan-2023)</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Challenges</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">We will be creating a self balancing hover board so some of the
      technical challenge will be getting the right motor and a programmable one so we can implement our self-
      balancing code.Another technical issue will be actually writing a self-balancing code with input sensors and
      other things for it to work,but I think if we work together we should be able to figure something out and make it work
      .Also I think that we can find a motor that would meet out expectations for our project from a older model or a brand new single wheel motor.
      Another technical challenge would be getting
      all the sensors that we need to make the finished product work.
      For example we would need a weight sensor that reads how the weight is across the board and then it would send signals
      to the main motor CPU and uses those reading to balance out the board by accelerating or decelerating .Most of these
      sensors are in cars so manufactures might be selling them so that how we could get them or worse case we could re-wire a old sensor to read weight.
      The biggest challenge will defiantly be scheduling.It would be hard because I have work and he might have work to which would make it
      hard to find a given time to work together.We would probably have to it online with discord or some other communicating app in order to
      work together on the project.I don't think there will be any interpersonal challenges,I used to know one of my team members so we might have
      some past chemistry that can help us work together.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:60px;">Roles/Jobs</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">(Software)Development Engineer</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">The development engineer is responsible for design and make the code for the overall project.They also build the different software systems
      within the given task.Their main task is to apply their software(coding) skills to real world things and developer to be ready to use with no flaws or errors.They also make
      sure the other team members code is also free of errors and help make the code run as fast and smooth as possible.Their also responsible for looking over all the code
      at the end or the publishing of a product or program.I think that I would give this job to someone that is in CS-III because they have more experience and can probably do a better job than me.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">QA Engineer</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A QA engineer (quality assurance engineer) is a professional who is responsible for testing and ensuring the quality of software and systems. QA engineers work to identify and fix defects and bugs in software, and to ensure that the software meets specified requirements and standards. They may work with developers to design and implement testing strategies, and may also work with users to gather feedback and identify issues. QA engineering is an important role in the software development process, as it helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and meets the needs of its users.We would probably need a complex group member to take care of this task and make sure that it all work correctly and nicely.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Project Manager</p>                                                                                                                                  <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, and overseeing the development of a project. They are responsible for setting project objectives, developing project plans, and managing project resources in order to deliver the project on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. Project managers may work on a wide range of projects, such as the construction of a building, the development of a new product, or the implementation of a new system or process. In order to be effective, project managers must have strong communication, organizational, and leadership skills. They must also be able to work under pressure and manage risk effectively.I fell like I would be capable to do this task because I have pretty well leadership skills and could lead a team in completing a good task on time.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Product Manager</p>
    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A product manager is a professional who is responsible for the development and management of a product throughout its life cycle. This can include identifying market opportunities, defining the product vision and road map, gathering and prioritizing product and customer requirements, and working with cross-functional teams to bring the product to market. Product managers typically work in technology or software companies, but can also be found in a variety of other industries. To be effective, product managers must have strong strategic and analytical skills, as well as excellent communication and leadership abilities. They must also be able to work effectively with cross-functional teams and to make decisions in a fast-paced, constantly-changing environment.I have some connections and know little things about advertising but I think that I could do this job by advertising.</p>

    <p class="M" style ="font-size:40px;">Release Engineer</p>
     <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A release engineer is a professional who is responsible for managing the release process for software or other systems. This can include tasks such as building and testing software, creating and maintaining documentation, coordinating with various teams and stakeholders, and deploying software to production environments. Release engineers often work closely with developers, QA engineers, and operations teams to ensure that releases are completed efficiently and effectively. In order to be effective in this role, release engineers should have strong technical skills and experience with software development and deployment processes. They should also have excellent communication and organizational skills, and be able to work well under pressure.I could also do this task because it involves in releasing and advertising the product.</p>
