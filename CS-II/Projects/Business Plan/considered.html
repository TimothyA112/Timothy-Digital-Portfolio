<p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Computer Sercurity)#1</a>
<p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">I think that this is a good idea becuase its good for public places and good for privacy.I would like to see a prototype of this product in action because
  I fell like it wouldnt work most of the time beacuse it might scan your face wrong and shut it off even thought its your computer.Also it shuts of everytime you look away which could be a issue,for example
  if someone calls your name or you get distracted by something and then you get back to work and you have to re-log in.I think if it worked perfectly it would be a good system but it probaly wont and thats why I have to
  decline this business plan.</p>

 <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Social Media Ad)#2</a>
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">I feel like this is already in effect in all social media platforms and it works well becuase its been working since social media has ever come out.Also the competition will probaly to much in my
   opinion,but if you can get it running and deal with the competion is probaly will be good.I have to decline becuae Fell like there is to much competion and its already been used many times.

 <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/avanish-jeendru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Cloths Sales)#3</a>
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">A shop that you can buy clothes on seems like its been on the internet since the internet existed.There is way to much competiton for this one
   and I would be hard for costs to advertise and get it to the people,But it would be cool to help students dress better and help them out with thier apperance.Im gonna have to
   decline becuase the risk of to much competition and it could make students uneasy if thier told they dont know how to dress.

 <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brayden-edington/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(School ID Scanners)#4</a>
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">I think this should be all rond the country already because this seems like a great way to prevent danger throughout the school and other things.There is one issue
   though someone could just wear a someone elses ID or make thier own ID that can bypass the scanner and they can just easily walk in acting like a student and cause harm.Im gonna decline due to easy
   way you could by pass the system by wearing a random students ID.

 <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/christopher-carter/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Game)#5</a>
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">I fell like no-one will play the game becuase getting to the desired audience will be the biggest challange.You would have to pay for ads on tiktok or instagram
   and the add would have to make the game look and fun and appealing to the viewer.Plus the competition is almost endless becuase everyone is trying to do this around the world.So im going to have decline.

 <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/david-ortega/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Therapy Game)#6</a>
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">This could be helpful to lots of stressfull students that have alot on thier mind at school,but it would be hard to get you game out to students and over all dosent see like a
   a good game.Also if you want to make revanue streams you need to charge people.That would make people wanna the play game even less.Im gonna decline.

 <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/devon-leerssen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Clicker Game)#7</a> 
 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">This circle clicking game is fun because ive played it before on may differnet websites.There is to many already popular games that have the same concept.If you made your game unique
   from the others and added somehting special it could be good.Also advertising would be a challenge as well.But if you could make it have some special features that serpates it it could be succesful.Im gonna decline.

     <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-ye/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Translater Code)#8</a> 
	 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">This is a cool idea and to see code translate differnet languages could be popular.It would also rank languages based thier learining curve.For exmaple
	   if someone is trying to learn a new languange and they dont know what they wanna learn they can use this code and see how the languages are ranked and chose what difficutly they want to chose to learn.
	   Im gonna decline becuase ther is over 200 languages an this is probaly near impossible.

	 <p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/heng-yi-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(Window Solar Panels)#9</a> 
	 <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">This seems like a good idea but it defintly exists somewhere.Its basicly just solar panels for your window.Also wouldnt this product block the window like a shade and at that point
	   yiu can just buy blinds becuase its gonna be blocking the window.Also solar panels are expensive and advertising will be hard so Im going to decline.

	<p> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/du-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> <p style="font-size:50px;"> Business Plan(1 Wheel HoverBoard)#10</a>                                                                                            <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">This would be a cool tranportation device,almost like hover board.My experice is that they take a while to get used to and with this slef-balancing feature it would be perfect for new riders.Overall it would be hard to read the weight of the rider and predict where there gonna go and where they shift their weight when is being used but it is possible.It would probaly make good sales though.I would accept this and plan and make and build this.
