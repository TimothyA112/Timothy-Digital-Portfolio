<p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">I think that this is a good idea becuase its good for public places and good for privacy.I would like to see a prototype of this product in action because
  I fell like it wouldnt work most of the time beacuse it might scan your face wrong and shut it off even thought its your computer.Also it shuts of everytime you look away which could be a issue,for example
  if someone calls your name or you get distracted by something and then you get back to work and you have to re-log in.I think if it worked perfectly it would be a good system but it probaly wont and thats why I have to
  decline this business plan.</p>
