<p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;"> A GPS system that allows School busses or school related transportation  systems to get from one place to  another with no stops in the quickest time possible.No red lights, no stop signs, no accidents and avoid traffic as best as possible.Almost like a police escort.</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:20px;">All around the globe Parents, Teachers and students heavily rely on School busses to get them to and from school.In most places School busses are kids only way of transportation because the parents are working or the students arnt old enough to have a car
  or they cant afford it.With longs routes, traffic, and accidents this often causes studrnts to be late to class and the teacher counts them as late and its not even thier fault.It also affects the teacher, because then they have to wait to start class.</p>



<p class="M" style ="font-size:20px;">There is a solution to this global problem,We could implemet a system that never stops the busses routes, almost like how ambulence and firerucks work on how they turn lights red so they can go, But this will work by it will give the best route to the bus driver with  no stops and minimum traffic.This guarantees the fastest and safest routes for the students and this will elminate the issues of Students being late and teachers having to start class not on time.</p>


<p class="M" style ="font-size:20px;"> We would advertise our system to the schools first and get thier funding by them or the goverment. Most schools would be right on board with "The Path".I belive this because I experince it everyday in almost every day in class, studnets constantly coming late to class and the teacher having to deal with this.With this new system this will never happen again. Then maybe we could expand out business to city busses for people that have jobs and other places to be. Also most of this would be supported by the city becuase it would help the city amazingly.</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:20px;"> Over all there is almost no competition except for the existing school bus system,but once "The Path" is in effect the old school buss system will fade in the new and improved one. The only other competion that we could think of was coding software for this system and how it might effect daily traffic in everyday life.

<p class="M" style ="font-size:20;"> We wouldn't be making that much money other than then what the school pays the us for the software and code and to implement The Path into the school busses system and GPS.So all together out total revaneu wouldn't be that high but for a small business it would be good sustanable income for time to come.</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:20;"> Like stated in previous text we would market out The Path software mainly to schools and their transportation system.I think that almost every school would be happy if they were given this offer.Also its a win win for all partys involved,We get to help students get to class on time and get a profit out of it,the schools gets to do its job alot more efficintly and teacher no longer have to wait for students to get to class on time.</p>

<p class="M" style ="font-size:20;"> Only costs and expenses are making the software and paying staff in order to make the code and advertise/market The Path to schools around the globe in order to make it worldwide and make it useful.</p>


<p class="M" style ="font-size:20;"> Some key roles in this project would be the main idealist which comes up with ideas. The main software engineer which will do most of the programing for The Paths software. Their will also be an finalst/editor that will look over the final ad or code and will make it look perfect and visualy appealing for the upcoming schools that will use this system.Also another team will be apart of the markting team which like stated before will go to schools and present The Path.</p>
