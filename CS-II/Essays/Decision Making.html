    <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">     Our teams ISP project will be a 1 wheeled skate board type of transportation system which uses various types of sensors to help the rider stay balanced.
      I believe that one of the one of the biases that we will encounter is the construction of the actual machine,but I think if we just make a blueprint/layout of the hover board we can make it.Also
      with the layout we can determine what kind of materials we need.For example we would probably need a wood block/base where the rider stands on,a rubber wheel,
      rechargeable electric motor,programmable weight,speedometer and distribution sensors around the board that will assist the rider to stay balanced.The wood would also need structural support so it doesn't bend or snap when the wight is on each side of it.
      Another problem that will come once where done making and publishing the 1 hover wheel is trying to make sells.Advertisement is always the hardest part
      to selling products or starting a business.I think if we consistently post tik toks over the hover board eventually once of the videos will get the trending
      page and will grab more peoples attention. At that point more and more people will be visiting out website where we will sell the product. The main thing
      that will help dive sales is our auto-balancing feature and  price points because the next option available is 1000$ when ours price  will be half or even less than other competitors.
     <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;"> Another bias will be the coding.The accelerator will be the most easy, but the sensors may pose an issue.For example set up a scale across the whole board and have it feedback to the code and then the code use that information to stabilize the board,by either
       speeding up or slowing down slowly or quickly.So overall coding the auto-balancing feature might be challenging.I think it is possible for us to make this code work.We could do an "if then" statement,for example if the weight distribution is to far to the front the board will accelerate accordingly to balance out the board and if the weight is more towards the back the board will slow down causing the rider to move forward and help the balance themselves easier.With this another issue rises,we cant just buy a basic motor and remote, we would need a programmable motor that attached to the wheel that can speed up and slow down the wheel its attached to.i think if we can get the right programmable parts then we should be able to construct a code and upload it into the motor and then connect it to the sensors and it should be able to auto-balance itself.
       <p class="M" style ="font-size:30px;">The main bias and the most difficult one will be the physical labor of building and assembling the board.Not to mansion testing the board.To actually build the board we would have to make a cut-out in exactly in the middle for the Be's balance and the motor would go on one side and we might need to add counter weight to compensate for the Harvey motor.Then we would to add a brace that holds the wheel in place but doesn't rub on any parts.Also adding the sensor and the metal brace and brackets will mess up the weight distribution, so we would also need to balance those out as well.Then we have the issue of actually testing the product once were finished.We would need one of us to actually use the board and see of the auto-balancing feature works,this could be dangerous because the board could behave strangely and do unpredictable things and cause the tester/rider to get flown off and get injured.A simple way to avoid this is to take it step by step. The first thing that we could do it just see if accelerates and decelerates with no rider. Then add weights like bricks or rocks on each side evenly  and see how the board behaves. Then at slow speeds add more weight on one side than another and see if auto-balances itself with the sensors. Then strap a closed bucket of water to the board and see how if behaves,I chose water because when the board accelerates the water moves toward the back of the board and this would case the board to self-balance and it would slow down, then the water would move to the front of the board and it would repeat this process unit the water it leveled again.After the water test I think it would be ready for human testing.I personally think it would be fun to test something like this even if it goes wrong.If one stage of testing fails then we know where to start and what to fix.Then we can go back and fix the issue and move on and repeat the process until its perfected.Then once a human can ride if comfortably and the auto-balance feature works we can start advertising it and start making revenue when we start producing and selling it.
