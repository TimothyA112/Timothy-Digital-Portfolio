<h1>AI Sentience</h1>

<h2>More beneficial or more harmful?</h2>

  
    <p class="M">
Artificial intelligence  has lots of benefits but with all good things some bad must come.Some beneficial things that come with AI are that they can appear
  as a real person and sometimes do the same tasks as a real human and sometimes better or worse"I know a person when I talk to it
  .It doesn't matter whether they have a brain of mean in their head.Or if they have a billion line of code"(Blake Lemoine pg.4)
  .This shows that they think that it can classify as a human no matter what it is made of,whether its flesh and skin or metal and
other non-organic materials.
</p>
<p class="M">Another issue is how people view A.I. "Some people cant tell the difference between science fiction and real life"(Andrew Feldman pg.6)
  .This lead to the disagreement that most people have with liking or disliking A.I.Some people are for it and others are extremely against it
  .There's no in between. Some think that AI. will make the world a better place and help us tremendously in the future to help solve issues and
  completing hard tasks,others think that A.I. will destroy the world and could get a conscience of their own and make their own decisions that
  could be harmful to the humans and the world.
</p>
<p class="M">In conclusion AI is beneficial but it can come with many different harmful side effects. Unless someone permanently fixes these issues and
  eliminate any risk of these defects we will have to wait to put AI in the real world and deal with human interactions.Overall it all depends
  on what the people fell and how the government wants to move foward with the next steps in Artificial intellagne
