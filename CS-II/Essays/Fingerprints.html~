<p class="M">
  There are 2 main primary purposes of a secure HTTPS connection,one of them is to enhance users security and privacy.The second one is over any of theses types of security HTTPS,SSL,TLS connection is extremely secure and not one person knows how to break it.The HTTPS Proxy Appliances is a new technology that gives the person the most basic assumption and guarantee that the browser is secure and private.MITM(man in the middle) is the basic term when a hacker or intruder positions himself in between the a user and another person in order to eavesdrop or act like he's on the other side of screen.
  This can be used to see what other are doing for good purposes,but it comes with many risks such as being able to spread false information and messes up communication between different parties.</p>
 <p class="M"> A hash is a complex mathematical algorithm that process every bit of information that goes through them a good hash is a hash that successfully changer information in order to make the whole code better.CA is computed aided coding and the role that it playes is it helps the coder with lost of basic computer assisted coding.SSL interception can be prevented by,decryptiona and logging.It can be detected by configuring different codes and seeing how it can be prevented.False-positive is when a code is wrong but it displayed that it is right.A false-negative is when its truly wrong from the beginning and this mean that the it must be changed.They don't have a right to watch your communications even they might.
